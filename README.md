# Overview

This is my portfolio website.  I made this website to try to help showcase some of my projects that I have built during my time at BYU-I.  My goal was to make it very simple with the layout and functionality. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  I then linked each of my projects to Github.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code by Microsoft to program all my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I also used GitHub Pages to host my web page.
