# Overview

This is my portfolio website.  I made this website to try to help showcase some of my projects that I have built during my time at BYU-I.  My goal was to make it very simple with the layout and functionality. I have a simple home page, about page and contact page.  The project page is imortant because I used one page to dynamically display multiple projects based off of what the user chooses.  I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  The only significant thing with the code is the JavaScript that produces each page based off of a template and a json file that it is given.  I then linked each of my projects to Github so people can view my source code for each project.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code by Microsoft to program all my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I also used GitHub Pages to host my web page.
