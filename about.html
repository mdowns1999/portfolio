                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Rexburg Idaho. I enjoy the outdoors,reading, and being with my family.
                        I am a Junior at BYU-I majoring in Software Engineering. I have taken classes in web
                        development, computer programming, and software design. Even though I am farily new to
                        programming, I strive to develop quality code and projects. I know a handful of languages. I am
                        more familiar with some than others, but those languages include: Python, C++, HTML, CSS,
                        Javascript, and MYSQL. The progress bars down below show my exact familiarity with each
                        language.</p>
